# Problem Statement

## Context & Pain Point
A common problem in Sri Lanka today is the lack of proper communication between the public and government officials.  
Citizens often struggle to get their concerns heard and addressed promptly. Many important issues remain unresolved for weeks or even months, despite repeated attempts to inform the authorities.

We frequently see such situations highlighted in the news. For example:
> "The road in our village has not been repaired yet, even though we have informed the authorities many times."

In many cases, once these problems are broadcast on television, solutions appear quickly — sometimes within a day or a few days.  
This shows that the core problem is **not the lack of resources**, but rather the absence of an effective and accountable communication channel between citizens and officials.

## Evidence
- Television news reports regularly feature unresolved public issues such as damaged roads, broken water supply systems, or poor waste management.
- These issues are often resolved only after being publicly highlighted, indicating a gap in direct and proactive government response.
- Citizens visiting local offices to report problems often face additional difficulties:
  - The relevant official is absent.
  - There is no prompt response or follow-up mechanism.
  - Complaints are not escalated to higher authorities in a timely manner.

## Scope
The current system lacks a **structured, transparent, and traceable communication process** for handling citizen issues.  
This results in delays, repeated visits, and loss of trust in public institutions.

Our solution — the **Citizen Issue Web Portal** — will allow Sri Lankan citizens to:
1. **Submit issues online** with proper details (description, category, and location).
2. **Automatically route** the issue to the relevant government official.
3. **Escalate unresolved issues** step-by-step to higher-level officers until resolved.
4. Provide citizens with **real-time status updates** on their complaints.

This approach will improve efficiency, accountability, and transparency in resolving public issues, while reducing the need for media intervention to get attention from authorities.
