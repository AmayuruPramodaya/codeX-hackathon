# Fix for "Invalid Session" Error in Password Setup

## Problem Identified
The `setup_password` endpoint was failing with "Invalid session" error because it was looking for login attempts with `is_successful=True`, but new Google users have `is_successful=False` initially.

## Root Cause
```python
# BEFORE (Problematic)
login_attempt = LoginAttempt.objects.get(
    id=session_id, 
    is_successful=True  # ❌ This was the issue!
)
```

For new Google users:
1. Google auth creates LoginAttempt with `is_successful=False`
2. User needs to set password first
3. But setup_password was requiring `is_successful=True`
4. This created a catch-22 situation

## Solution Applied

### 1. **Fixed Session Lookup**
```python
# AFTER (Fixed)
login_attempt = LoginAttempt.objects.get(id=session_id)
# ✅ Removed is_successful=True requirement
```

### 2. **Mark Session Successful After Password Setup**
```python
# Set password
user.set_password(password)
user.save()

# Mark login attempt as successful now that password is set
login_attempt.is_successful = True
login_attempt.save()
```

### 3. **Added Debug Logging**
```python
print(f"Password setup request - Session ID: {session_id}")
print(f"Found login attempt - Email: {login_attempt.email}")
print(f"Found user: {user.username} ({user.email})")
```

### 4. **Enhanced Response**
```python
return Response({
    'message': 'Password set successfully. Please complete 2FA setup.',
    'user': {
        'id': user.id,
        'username': user.username,
        'email': user.email,
        'user_type': user.user_type,
    },
    'otp_required': True,
    'session_id': session_id
}, status=status.HTTP_200_OK)
```

## Fixed Flow Now

### **Google Sign-Up Process:**
1. **Google OAuth** → Creates LoginAttempt with `is_successful=False`
2. **Password Setup** → ✅ Now works (doesn't require is_successful=True)
3. **Mark Successful** → Sets `is_successful=True` after password setup
4. **2FA Setup** → Proceeds to OTP verification
5. **Complete** → User logged in successfully

## Testing
The Django server has automatically reloaded with the changes. You can now test the Google sign-up flow:

1. Go to http://localhost:3001/
2. Click "Sign in with Google"
3. Complete Google authentication
4. **Create password** → Should now work without "Invalid session" error
5. Complete 2FA setup
6. ✅ Success!

## Status
- ✅ **Fixed**: "Invalid session" error in password setup
- ✅ **Enhanced**: Better error handling and logging
- ✅ **Improved**: More detailed API responses
- ✅ **Ready**: For testing the complete Google sign-up flow

The password setup should now work correctly for Google sign-up users!
