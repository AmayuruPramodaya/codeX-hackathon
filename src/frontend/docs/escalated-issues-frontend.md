# Escalated Issues Frontend Implementation

## Overview
The escalated issues functionality has been successfully added to the frontend, allowing government officials (especially Grama Niladhari users) to track issues that have been escalated from their jurisdiction to higher levels.

## New Features Added

### 1. **EscalatedIssues Component** (`/frontend/src/pages/EscalatedIssues.jsx`)
- **Purpose**: Display issues that have been escalated from the user's jurisdiction
- **Access**: Only available to government officials
- **Features**:
  - Filter by status and current level
  - Shows escalation details and timeline
  - Displays current handler and level
  - Color-coded priority and status indicators

### 2. **IssueManagement Component** (`/frontend/src/pages/IssueManagement.jsx`)
- **Purpose**: Main issue management interface for government officials
- **Features**: 
  - Shows current issues assigned to user's level
  - Quick access to escalated issues
  - Filter and sort capabilities

### 3. **Updated API Service** (`/frontend/src/services/api.js`)
- Added `getEscalatedIssues()` function
- Added `getMyIssues()` function
- Proper error handling and authentication

### 4. **Enhanced Navigation** 
- Updated Header component to include "Escalated Issues" link for government officials
- Updated Dashboard with quick access buttons
- New routes added to App.jsx

## User Interface

### For Government Officials:
1. **Dashboard**: Shows overview with quick access to escalated issues
2. **Header Navigation**: "Escalated Issues" link in user menu
3. **Issue Management**: Main issue handling interface
4. **Escalated Issues**: Separate tracking interface

### New Routes:
- `/escalated-issues` - View escalated issues
- `/manage-issues` - Issue management dashboard

## Key Features

### Escalation Information Display:
- **From/To Levels**: Color-coded badges showing escalation path
- **Escalation Reason**: Why the issue was escalated
- **Timeline**: When escalation occurred
- **Current Handler**: Who is handling it now

### Filtering Options:
- **By Status**: pending, in_progress, resolved, closed
- **By Current Level**: Shows where the issue is now
- **Visual Priority**: Color-coded priority indicators

### User Experience:
- **Restricted Access**: Only government officials can view
- **Real-time Updates**: Shows current status
- **Responsive Design**: Works on all devices
- **Intuitive Interface**: Easy to understand escalation flow

## How It Works

### For Grama Niladhari Users:
1. **Submit/Handle Issues**: Issues start at GN level
2. **Auto-Escalation**: After 3 days, issues escalate to DS level
3. **Tracking**: GN users can now see their escalated issues in separate list
4. **Transparency**: Full visibility into escalation process

### Escalation Flow:
```
GN Level → DS Level → District → Provincial → National → PM
```

### UI States:
- **Current Issues**: Issues at user's level (main workflow)
- **Escalated Issues**: Issues escalated from user's jurisdiction (tracking)
- **Color Coding**: Visual indicators for status, priority, and levels

## API Integration

### Endpoints Used:
- `GET /api/issues/escalated/` - Fetch escalated issues
- `GET /api/issues/` - Fetch current issues
- `GET /api/issues/my/` - Fetch user's submitted issues

### Authentication:
- JWT token-based authentication
- Automatic token refresh
- Protected routes for government officials only

## Visual Design

### Color Scheme:
- **Red Border**: Escalated issues have red left border
- **Level Badges**: Different colors for each government level
- **Status Indicators**: Traffic light system (green=good, yellow=pending, red=urgent)
- **Priority Dots**: Color-coded priority indicators

### Layout:
- **Card-based Design**: Each issue in a clean card layout
- **Information Hierarchy**: Important details prominently displayed
- **Responsive Grid**: Adapts to different screen sizes

## Testing the Feature

### As a Grama Niladhari User:
1. Login with GN credentials
2. Go to Dashboard → see "View Escalated Issues" button
3. Navigate to "Escalated Issues" from header menu
4. View issues that have been escalated from your jurisdiction
5. See escalation timeline and current handler

### Expected Behavior:
- ✅ GN users see 0 current issues (after escalation)
- ✅ GN users see 1 escalated issue with full details
- ✅ Escalation information clearly displayed
- ✅ Access restricted to government officials only

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Transparency**: Officials can track their escalated cases
2. **Accountability**: Clear audit trail visible to original handlers
3. **User Experience**: Separate lists prevent confusion
4. **Workflow Efficiency**: Easy navigation between current and escalated issues
5. **Visual Clarity**: Color-coded system makes status immediately apparent

## Next Steps

### Potential Enhancements:
1. **Real-time Notifications**: Alert when issues are escalated
2. **Escalation Analytics**: Charts showing escalation trends
3. **Bulk Actions**: Handle multiple issues at once
4. **Mobile App**: Native mobile interface
5. **Email Notifications**: Automatic notifications for escalations

### Integration Notes:
- All components are responsive and accessible
- Error handling implemented throughout
- Loading states provided for all async operations
- Consistent with existing design system

## Conclusion

The escalated issues functionality is now fully integrated into the frontend, providing government officials with complete visibility and tracking capabilities for their escalated cases. The implementation follows React best practices and integrates seamlessly with the existing codebase.
