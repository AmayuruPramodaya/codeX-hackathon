# ‚úÖ ESCALATED ISSUES IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE

## Summary

Your requirement: **"lower user(gn) shude see that as a escalaed list"** has been **successfully implemented**.

## What We Built

### 1. **New API Endpoint**
- **URL**: `/api/issues/escalated/`
- **Purpose**: Shows GN users their escalated issues in a separate list
- **Security**: Only authenticated government officials can access

### 2. **New Serializer: `EscalatedIssueSerializer`**
- Includes escalation information (`latest_escalation`, `original_level`)
- Shows escalation timeline and details
- Provides transparency about escalation process

### 3. **New View: `EscalatedIssuesView`**
- Filters issues escalated from user's jurisdiction
- Supports filtering by status, priority, current_level
- Handles different user types (GN, DS, etc.)

### 4. **Updated URL Configuration**
- Added route: `path('issues/escalated/', EscalatedIssuesView.as_view(), name='escalated-issues')`

## How It Works

### Before Implementation:
- ‚ùå GN user loses track of escalated issues
- ‚ùå No visibility into what happened to their cases
- ‚ùå Issues disappear from their view completely

### After Implementation:
- ‚úÖ **Main Issues List** (`/api/issues/`): Shows only current GN-level issues (0 issues)
- ‚úÖ **Escalated Issues List** (`/api/issues/escalated/`): Shows escalated issues (1 issue)
- ‚úÖ **Transparency**: GN users can track their escalated cases
- ‚úÖ **Hierarchical**: DS users see escalated issues in their main list

## Test Results

```
GN Current Issues: 0      ‚Üê Issue no longer in main list
GN Escalated Issues: 1    ‚Üê Issue visible in escalated list
DS Current Issues: 1      ‚Üê DS sees the escalated issue
```

## Frontend Integration

The frontend can now implement:

1. **Separate "Escalated Issues" Tab/Section**
   ```javascript
   // Fetch escalated issues
   const escalatedIssues = await fetch('/api/issues/escalated/');
   ```

2. **Enhanced Issue Cards**
   - Show escalation status badges
   - Display escalation timeline
   - Indicate current level

3. **Dashboard Sections**
   - "My Current Issues" (active cases)
   - "My Escalated Issues" (tracking escalated cases)

## API Usage Examples

### Get Escalated Issues
```bash
GET /api/issues/escalated/
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

### Filter by Current Level
```bash
GET /api/issues/escalated/?current_level=divisional_secretary
```

### Sort by Escalation Date
```bash
GET /api/issues/escalated/?ordering=-updated_at
```

## Response Format

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "reference_number": "GS20257B073A30",
  "title": "Road repair needed",
  "current_level": "divisional_secretary",
  "escalation_count": 1,
  "latest_escalation": {
    "from_level": "grama_niladhari",
    "to_level": "divisional_secretary",
    "reason": "Auto-escalated due to no response within deadline",
    "escalated_at": "2025-08-07T18:38:24.159765Z"
  },
  "original_level": "grama_niladhari"
}
```

## Files Modified

1. **`main/views.py`**: Added `EscalatedIssuesView`
2. **`main/serializers.py`**: Added `EscalatedIssueSerializer`
3. **`main/urls.py`**: Added escalated issues route
4. **`docs/escalated_issues_api.md`**: API documentation

## Benefits Achieved

‚úÖ **Transparency**: GN users can track escalated cases  
‚úÖ **Accountability**: Clear escalation audit trail  
‚úÖ **User Experience**: Separate lists prevent confusion  
‚úÖ **Hierarchical Workflow**: Each level sees appropriate issues  
‚úÖ **API Consistency**: RESTful endpoint with proper filtering  

## Next Steps for Frontend

1. Add "Escalated Issues" section to GN user dashboard
2. Implement issue status badges showing escalation
3. Create escalation timeline view
4. Add filtering/sorting controls for escalated issues

## Conclusion

The escalated issues system is now complete and working as requested. GN users can:
- See their current active issues in the main list
- Track their escalated issues in a separate escalated list  
- Maintain visibility and transparency throughout the escalation process
